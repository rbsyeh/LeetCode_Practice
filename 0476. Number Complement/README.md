# 476. Number Complement

## Difficulty

**`Easy`** Medinm Hard

## Description

Given a **positive** integer `num`, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

### Example 1:

<pre>

<b>Input:</b> num = 5

<b>Output:</b> 2

<b>Explanation:</b> The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
</pre>

### Example 2:

<pre>

<b>Input:</b> num = 1

<b>Output:</b> 0

<b>Explanation:</b> The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
</pre>

### Constraints:

* The given integer `num` is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
* `num >= 1`
* You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
* This question is the same as [1009](https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/)
