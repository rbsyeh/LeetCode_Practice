# 344. Reverse String

## Difficulty

**`Easy`** Medinm Hard

## Description

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `char[]`.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array** [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of [printable ascii characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters).

### Example 1:

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> ["h","e","l","l","o"]
<b>Output:</b> ["o","l","l","e","h"]
</pre>

### Example 2:

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
<b>Output:</b> ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
</pre>
